Build a personal portfolio website with a clean and dark theme. The design should be aesthetic, professional, and minimalist, suitable for a developer or designer portfolio. Prioritize readability, subtle animations, and a structured layout that is easy to edit manually using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

⚠️ DO NOT use frameworks like React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Bootstrap, or jQuery. The output must be pure HTML (.html), CSS (.css), and JavaScript (.js) with a clean and modular folder structure.

🎨 Design Goals:
Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile)

Dark mode with soft contrast and modern UI/UX

Minimalistic layout with lots of whitespace and a clean font (e.g., Inter, Poppins, or Montserrat)

Smooth hover effects (fade, scale, underline transitions)

Consistent section spacing and elegant dividers

Use scroll-reveal or fade-in effects for section entrance

Code should be well-commented and modular

🧩 Website Sections:
1️⃣ Home (Hero Section)
Full-screen welcome area with a greeting headline (e.g., “Hi, I’m [Name]”) and a short tagline

Sticky, minimal navigation bar with smooth scroll links to each section

Optionally include a profile image or animated background element

2️⃣ About Me
Two-paragraph layout to describe background (education, interests, etc.)

Section heading: “About Me”

Use clean typography and a small icon or divider for visual polish

Fade-in text on scroll

3️⃣ Experience
Section heading: “Experience”

Timeline or card format for each internship/job

Include placeholders for:
  • Role
  • Company
  • Duration
  • Short bullet points for key tasks or impact

Ensure layout is modular and easy to duplicate for future additions

4️⃣ Projects
Section heading: “Projects”

Display projects in a responsive grid of cards

Each card should include:
  • Project image thumbnail (with hover effect)
  • Project title
  • 2-line description
  • Tech stack badges or pill-style labels

On hover, show animated overlay or popup with more details

Allow for unlimited projects to be added dynamically without breaking design

5️⃣ Skills & Tools
Section heading: “Technical Skills”

Two-column layout:
  • Tech Stack: (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS, React, Node.js, MongoDB, Java)
  • Tools: (e.g., GitHub, Figma, Canva, Power BI, Zapier)

Use custom icons or logos with tooltips or light hover effect

Organized in clean rows or grid layout

6️⃣ Contact
Section heading: “Get in Touch” or “Contact”

Upload/view resume button

Social icons with links for LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter

Clickable email address (mailto)

Optionally, include a simple contact form with name/email/message inputs (no backend required)

🛠️ Technical Requirements:
Output folder should contain:
  • index.html
  • style.css
  • script.js

All code should be cleanly structured, well-indented, and include HTML comments for each section

Use semantic HTML5 tags (<section>, <nav>, <article>, etc.)

Minimal use of external libraries — only use icons/fonts via CDN (e.g., Google Fonts, Font Awesome)

✅ Final Output:
A responsive, professional, aesthetic portfolio website

Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JS

Easy to edit, update, and deploy manually (e.g., via GitHub or Netlify)
